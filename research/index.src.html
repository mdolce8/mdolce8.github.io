<p>
    My thesis research is to use Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) -- a Bayesian inference tool --
    with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on the <a href="https://novaexperiment.fnal.gov/">NOvA</a> Near and Far Detector data to
    obtain best fit values for the parameters that govern neutrino oscillation.

<h3 id="binding-energy"> Nuclear Binding Energy </h3>
<p>
    In neutrino interactions, neutrinos commonly interact with a single proton/neutron rather than the whole nucleus.
    However, because protons/neutrons (i.e. a nucleon) live within a nucleus, a nucleon that is observed by a detector has
    overcome some "potential" energy to exit the nucleus from which it was bound -- often called the <b>nuclear binding energy</b>.
    This energy is critical in neutrino experiments because in order to measure the parameters that govern its oscillation,
    we must reconstruct the neutrino's energy as precisely as possible.
    This includes the nuclear binding energy since this energy lost to the nucleus originated from the neutrino.
    This potential energy is very difficult to directly measure and various models have been proposed to correctly account for this energy (sometimes also called the removal energy).
    My work involved was to incorporate a specific binding energy physics model into the NOvA experiment's simulation and
    determine the impact of the model on NOvA's prediction.

    <!-- include the image I gave for FSI talk -->
    Also within the nucleus is a phenomenon called Final State Interactions (FSI).
    When a neutrino interacts with a neutron inside the nucleus, a proton is created and in some cases produces a pion.
    This pion must also traverse the nuclear medium before it can be observed in our detectors.
    However, there a number of interactions a pion can experience before we can observe it.
    For example, the pion can be absorbed into the nucleus, and therefore is never observed in our detector.
    In this case, the estimate for the true neutrino energy would be missing the contribution of energy from the pion,
    further hindering a reasonable estimate of the true neutrino energy (similar to the binding energy), and
    therefore preventing a precise measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters.
    To improve NOvA's simulation, I have tuned an existing FSI physics model to form better agreement with external data.
    By improving this FSI model, NOvA can more accurately predict when such a FSI interaction occurs, such as the example
    of an absorbed pion in the nucleus, thereby improving NOvA's simulation to predict neutrino energies and their interactions.

<h3 id="uboone-study"> Signal processing of MicroBooNE detector </h3>

<!--<div style="clear: left"><p style="float: left;"><img src="uboone.jpeg" height="180px" width="180px" border="1px" alt="uboone-image"></p>-->
<p> The MicroBooNE neutrino experiment uses a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector
    to provide high resolution reconstruction of particle interactions.
    In this LArTPC, there is a single anode wire plane with a voltage applied that collects charges from interacting particles.
    In this study, data was collected of various anode voltage configurations and I identified which voltage configuration
    produced the strongest signal from background noise
    by measuring the charge deposited from tracks in a series of different orientations.

    <!--        Data was collected for various voltage strengths of the anode plane to produce the study.-->

<h3 id="#nutau-optimization"> Optimization of tau neutrinos in DUNE </h3>
<p>
    The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), is the neutrino experiment of
    the future.
    It will not begin taking data for a few more years. However, there are many studies that
    can be done before data-taking begins. For example, to understand how to
    optimize the appearance of tau neutrinos in the DUNE Far Detectors.
    My study sought to understand this question by analyzing configurations of the
    target complex at the Long Baseline Neutrino Facitilty (LBNF) in Fermilab, the source
    of the neutrino beam.

<h2 id="LP">III. HHMI Listening Project</h2>
Tufts University is an active member in the <a href=" https://www.hhmi.org/science-education/programs/inclusive-excellence"> Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> (HHMI)
Listening Project.
The project seeks to "substantially and sustainably increase their capacity for inclusion of all students, especially those students who belong to groups underrepresented
in science."
Throughout the year, Tufts STEM faculty and graduate students meet to elicit and engage with student thinking from real student interactions from our own classes.
<br>
As a teaching assistant (TA) for introductory physics courses, I contributed several of my own classroom interactions with students to group sessions
with faculty and graduate students where we can improve our ability to listen to and understand student thinking in the various forms in a college classroom.
<br>
In the last several years I have been a coach for new graduate students involved in the Listening Project.
Throughout the semester I meet with pairs of Listeners to engage in student artifacts from their classes and to improve
their listening to students' thoughts and ideas.
